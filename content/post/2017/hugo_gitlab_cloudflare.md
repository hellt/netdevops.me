title: Setting up a Hugo blog with GitLab and CloudFlare

---

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) gets a lot of [attention](https://www.staticgen.com/hugo) these days, it is basically snapping at the Jekyll' heels which is still the king of the hill! I don't know if Hugo' popularity coupled with **the fastest static-site-generator** statement, but for me "speed" is not the issue at all. A personal blog normally has few hundreds posts, not even close to thousands to be worried about slowness.

Then if it is not for speed then why did I choose Hugo? Because it became a solid product with a crowded community and all the common features available. _(To be honest I also got an illusion that one day I might start sharpen my Go skills through Hugo as well)_.

As you already noticed, this blog is powered by **Hugo**, is running on **GitLab pages**, with SSL certificate from **CloudFlare** and costs me **$0**. And I would like to write down the key pieces that'll probably be of help on your path to a zero-cost personal blog/cv/landing/etc.

<!--more-->
The key ingredients of a modern zero-cost blog powered by a Static Site Generator are:

1. Version Control System -- **Git**
2. Web-based version control repository -- **GitLab**/Github
4. Web server -- **GitLab Pages**/GitHub Pages
3. Static Site Generator Engine -- **Hugo**/Jekyll/Hexo/Pelican/many-others
5. SSL Certificate provider -- **Cloudflare**/LetsEncrypt _(optional)_
6. Custom domain linked to a free one from GitLab/Github _(optional)_

While Git and GitLab/GitHub are of obvious choice we better discuss the `Hugo + GitLab CI + GitLab pages + Cloudflare` mix that I chose to enable this blog.

# Hugo
Hugo installation is ridiculously easy, thanks to Golang that powers it. Download a single `hugo` binary from the [official repo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and thats it. No need for virtualenvs, npms and alike, a single binary is all you need.

Once the binary is in your `$PATH` create a site skeleton with
```
hugo new site <yourBlogName>
```

For details refer to the [QuickStart guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to get a locally running site under 5 minutes.

### Theme
Hugo community produced over 100+ themes for different needs. As to me, most of them are ugly, or as minimalistic as the blogspot. Probably the hardest thing in the whole process is to find a theme that suits you. This blog uses a [Tranquilpeak](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/) theme.

To onboard a chosen theme follow the quickstart guide' [step 3](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-3-add-a-theme).

# GitLab
Now when you have an engine and a theme coupled together its GitLab' part to present your content to the world. GitLab has the [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) service created just for what we need and highligted by being: 

* free
* SSG-agnostic
* SSL & custom domains ready 

It has more whistles than Github pages and is completely free without any limitations.

There is a [comprehensive guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) about onboarding a static generated site within GitLab, I will boil it down to a few steps (you can always peer into [my repo](https://gitlab.com/rdodin/netdevops.me) for a complete code and settings):

1. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of your repo with the [`pages`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/#pages) job
    ```bash
    pages:
    # this image is slimmer than official one; based on Alpine
    image: fundor333/hugo 
    script:
        - hugo
    # send all files from public directory to the CI server
    artifacts:
        paths:
          - public
    only:
        - master  # this job will affect only the 'master' branch
    ```
    Note, that you can put the exact same content in your file, there are no custom parts here.

2. Find your `baseurl` and put it into `config.toml` of your Hugo site. A base URL depends on how did you create a GitLab project. Is it a project placed under you personal account or a under a group? All the options are outlined in the [official docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/pages/getting_started_part_one.html#gitlab-pages-domain).

3. Make a commit with the contents of your blog and push the changes to the master branch `git push origin master`. That will automatically trigger the `pages` job to build your site and start serving it from https://yournamespace.gitlab.io

4. At this point you are good to go, you have TLS certificate provided by Gitlab for `*.gitlab.io` namespace, your posts will be automatically generated once you push to `master` branch and your texts are in VSC. WIN! 

You can stop here and start generate the content, but if you are up to custom domain or custom TLS certificate -> continue to read.

## Custom domain
Having your site to render by _myawesome.blog_ URL instead of _gitlab.io_ is solid. For that you just need a `A` or `CNAME` DNS record provisioned as [explained in the docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/pages/getting_started_part_three.html). I chose to delegate my **netdevops.me** domain to Cloudflare, since they provide a TLS certificate for free.

## TLS (SSL) certificates
Two common free options when we talk about TLS certs are LetsEncrypt and Cloudflare certs. I am no security expert to claim that one is better than other, I chose a path that is easier, which is [Cloudflare FlexSSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/) in my case.

{{< image classes="center fancybox clear" src="https://www.cloudflare.com/img/products/ssl/flexible-ssl.svg" title="Cloudflare FlexSSL" >}}

>**Flexible SSL** encrypts traffic from Cloudflare to end users of your website, but not from Cloudflare to your origin server. This is the easiest way to enable HTTPS because it doesnâ€™t require installing an SSL certificate on your origin. While not as secure as the other options, Flexible SSL does protect your visitors from a large class of threats including public WiFi snooping and ad injection over HTTP.

Implications are clear, FlexSSL is free but does not make secure connection end-to-end, which is fine with me.

FlexSSL configuration is as easy as going to **Crypto** pane in the Cloudflare admin panel and enabling _Flexible SSL_:

In that case nothing is needed to be configured in GitLab, just enjoy your TLS-enabled site.

In case you want to enable end-to-end encryption (Strict SSL) there is a thorough [guide from Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/07/setting-up-gitlab-pages-with-cloudflare-certificates/) covering every step.

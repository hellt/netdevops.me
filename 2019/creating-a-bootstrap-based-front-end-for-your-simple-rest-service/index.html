Other times even the CLI is not needed, as the tool is only used as a plugged-in library.</p><p>But quite often the tool can benefit greatly by having its own web interface. You can broaden the horizons of your project audience vastly by simply creating a web service out of it. I can name a handful number of tools that I consume via web instead of using their CLI counterparts, it is just more convenient to me and so might think the users of your tools.</p><p>The <a href=https://github.com/dbarrosop/pycatj/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer"><code>pycatj</code></a> is a perfect example of a CLI-first tool that can be conveniently consumed via web as well. Thus I set myself on a journey to create a web facade for it and at the same time reinforcing my very basic web skills.</p><h3 id=12-take-your-pitch-or-demo-to-a-next-level class=headerLink><a href=#12-take-your-pitch-or-demo-to-a-next-level class=header-mark></a>1.2 Take your pitch or demo to a next level</h3><p>Not everyone of us is working in an environment where the bosses have engineering background and can equally enjoy a demo of a new service by looking at the terminal full of <code>curl</code> requests. Even if your bosses are the ones who contribute to the cutting edge technologies, your customers can easily be made of a different dough.</p><p>Therefore it might be equally important to supplement your neat idea with a proper visualization; my experience says that a great tool or a service attracts audience way better when it is wrapped in a shiny package. So having a prototyped web UI might give you some bonus points even if it is not going to be consumed via the Web UI after all.</p><h3 id=13-learn-how-they-do-it-on-the-other-side-of-a-fence class=headerLink><a href=#13-learn-how-they-do-it-on-the-other-side-of-a-fence class=header-mark></a>1.3 Learn how they do it on the other side of a fence</h3><p>A classic, book-pictured network automation engineer is an all Python-shop customer. Although Python is a natural fit for the network automation activities, it is also important to not less yourself be constrained by a singe language or a toolchain.</p><p>Educating yourself on a different technology with a different set of the instruments and/or the views means a lot. Even by scratching the surface of the Javascript, its package managers and the front-end frameworks could make you better understand the pros and cons of the ecosystem you are in.</p><h2 id=2-front-end--javascript-frameworks class=headerLink><a href=#2-front-end--javascript-frameworks class=header-mark></a>2 Front-end & Javascript frameworks</h2><p><img loading=lazy decoding=async class=render-image src=https://gitlab.com/rdodin/pics/-/wikis/uploads/6e95f9e54f4062d13e314fc1b4d78266/image.png alt=pic title=image.png></p><p>So how do one start if they want to learn any of that shiny front-end witchery given that there are so many frameworks around? In spite to answer this question I compiled the following list of options that when I approached the task of making a <a href=https://pycatjify.netdevops.me target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer"><code>pycatjify</code></a> web service:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Frameworkless: bare HTML/CSS/JS</strong><br>This is the most straightforward way of creating a web service. You basically write everything by yourself without relying on any framework.<br>On the <em>pros</em> side this is the most lightweight and bloat-less approach, as you are in the full control of what contributes to the end result.<br>The <em>cons</em> side is substantial though, you need to be well experienced in the HTML/CSS/JS to create something less minimalistic than a blank page with the elements on it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Front-end frameworks</strong><br>Front-end frameworks provide a shortcut for a web service creation drastically reducing time to create one. Also known as CSS frameworks they come across with the lego-like blocks (components implemented with CSS/JS/HTML) that you use to build a web service from.<br>Dozens of front-end frameworks have been created over the time, from the minimalistic ones to the monstrous software bundles.<br><a href=https://getbootstrap.com target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Bootstrap</a>, <a href=https://foundation.zurb.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Foundation</a>, <a href=http://getskeleton.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Skeleton</a>, <a href=https://materializecss.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Materialize</a> are one of the few that one can find in the numerous &ldquo;top front-end frameworks&rdquo; charts.<br>A major benefit that all above mentioned frameworks share is that they don&rsquo;t need to be compiled and can be run by all modern browsers. All it takes is to put the framework' HTML/CSS/JS files along with your project and open the <code>index.html</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Javascript frameworks and libraries: React/Angular/Vue/etc</strong><br>These are the modern age Javascript frameworks (often referred as libraries) that enable you to build modern web/mobile applications with a feature-rich logic. With the great power, though, comes the great size and complexity; installing a sample React app can easily add thousands of JS packages that framework depends on.<br>The learning curve for these frameworks is steep as opposed to the front-end frameworks listed in [2]. But mastering one of them would enable you to create versatile and breathtaking Web UIs as well as mobile applications.<br>Notable frameworks in that category are <a href=https://reactjs.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">React</a>, <a href=https://vuejs.org target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Vue</a>, <a href=https://angular.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Angular</a>, <a href=https://emberjs.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Ember</a>.</p></li></ol><p>Since I am not a front-end developer the sweet spot for me lies with the front-end frameworks that I can install/run without a specific harness. They are lightweight, easy to work with, and all it takes to start is the basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge. At the same time they provide just enough features to handle not overly complicated tasks a network engineer might encounter in a small size projects.</p><p>For the <a href=https://pycatjify.netdevops.me target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">pycatjify.netdevops.me</a> I decided to use a &ldquo;Material Design&rdquo; flavored Bootstrap based framework called <a href=https://mdboostrap.com target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">mdboostrap</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Also I had some past experience with the Bootstrap 3 framework when I worked on <a href=https://netdevops.me/2016/04/building-web-front-end-for-python-scripts-with-flask/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">a Web UI for the python scripts</a> quite some time ago.</p></blockquote><h2 id=3-mdbootstrap class=headerLink><a href=#3-mdbootstrap class=header-mark></a>3 Mdbootstrap</h2><p><img loading=lazy decoding=async class=render-image src=https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/logo-mdb-jquery-small.png alt="mdb logo" title=logo-mdb-jquery-small.png>
Mdbootstrap (MDB) offers the Material-UI themed components for the various JS frameworks such as Bootstrap/JQuery, Angular, React and Vue. For the reasons outlined in section 2, I decided to go with a <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Bootstrap/JQuery version</a> of the MDB framework as this is the easiest way to put up a simple front-end service for me.</p><blockquote><p>MDB offers a free <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/education/bootstrap/quick-start/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">quick start guide</a> as well as a <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/education/bootstrap/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">full-length</a> tutorial if you want to refresh the bootstrap basics or follow an authored paid course.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bootstrap popularity also makes it extremely easy to find a lot of guides and tutorials that tremendously help to understand the basics of this framework.</p></blockquote><p>MDB, being based on the Bootstrap 4, obviously follows its ancestors paradigms when it comes to the Grid system, CSS, components, etc. If you worked with the Bootstrap before then the MDB won&rsquo;t be a problem at all. Moreover, the elements I used in this project are not MDB specific, the same components are available in the original Bootstrap library.</p><h3 id=31-install-the-framework class=headerLink><a href=#31-install-the-framework class=header-mark></a>3.1 Install the framework</h3><p>Its extremely easy to &ldquo;install&rdquo; mdbootstrap/bootstrap framework, its hardly an installation even, as all you need is to <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/getting-started/download/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">download</a> the archive and extract the framework' files.

These CSS files comprise a big portion of the framework itself, as they govern the styling that the components have.</p><p>Then the <a href=https://gist.github.com/hellt/f0878010813c21837a518d89f36f5e61#file-index-html-L19-L44 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer"><code>&lt;body></code></a> section of the HTML file holds the default web page&rsquo;s content.<br>The <code>index.html</code> file that comes with a template has a <code>div</code> with a few headers and a paragraph of text. You will replace then with the framework components like Navigation bars, input forms, tables, text elements, modal dialogs when you start to build your front-end service.</p><p>In the <a href=https://gist.github.com/hellt/f0878010813c21837a518d89f36f5e61#file-index-html-L35-L43 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">ending</a> of the <code>&lt;body></code> section you would find the <code>&lt;script></code> elements that load the Javascript code the framework relies on. The custom JS code that your service most likely will have will also be added in the body&rsquo;s tail section (see <a href=#4-hooking-up-the-back-end rel>section 4</a> for an example).</p><h3 id=33-bootstrap-components-are-your-lego-blocks class=headerLink><a href=#33-bootstrap-components-are-your-lego-blocks class=header-mark></a>3.3 Bootstrap components are your lego blocks</h3><p>The framework&rsquo;s library has a lot of components that might be treated like the lego blocks with which you build the web facade. The benefit of having the pre-created components is huge; you don&rsquo;t need to create these common components yourself from the ground up, just browse the library and pick the right ones.</p><blockquote><p><img loading=lazy decoding=async class=render-image src=https://gitlab.com/rdodin/pics/-/wikis/uploads/cb491f0ab8842f37bcd76f8557102d72/image.png alt=components title=image.png></p><center><small>Example of the tabs & pills components</small></center></blockquote><p>To understand which components I&rsquo;d need for the pycatjify I imagined what layout would I want my page to have. Since <code>pycatj</code> is a tool that works on an input JSON/YAML data and produces a multi line output, the simple layout could consist of a <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/navigation/navbar/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">navigation bar</a> with the project logo, the two <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/forms/inputs/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">input fields</a> for input and output data and the <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/modals/basic/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">modal dialog</a> with <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/components/cards/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">cards</a>.</p><p>Knowing the needed basic building blocks we can now browse the framework' <a href=https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">documentation</a> section in search for the right ones. The MDB docs are just great for that - lots of examples on how to use the various components in different kinds of shapes and sizes. Basically you copy the example from the docs, paste it to your HTML file and tune it as per the components options which are explained in the docs.</p><p>When building pycatjify front-end I just removed the default contents of the <code>&lt;body></code> section of the <code>index.html</code> file and started to throw in the components as per the layout I had in my head. Thats what the <a href=https://github.com/hellt/pycatj-web/blob/master/pycatj-web/index.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer"><code>index.html</code></a> for the <a href=https://pycatjify.netdevops.me target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">pycatjify.netdevops.me</a> started to look like when I added all the components I talked above.</p><p>It looks like a lot of lines of code, but everything was just pasted from the examples section. First time it takes some time to get to know the components and their behavior, but do it once and the next project would be an effortless task.</p><blockquote><p><img loading=lazy decoding=async class=render-image src=https://gitlab.com/rdodin/pics/-/wikis/uploads/6a42e976d4a8a732b6b62f1e2f58a7dd/image.png alt=pic title=image.png></p><center><small>pycatjify web ui</small></center></blockquote><h2 id=4-hooking-up-the-back-end class=headerLink><a href=#4-hooking-up-the-back-end class=header-mark></a>4 Hooking up the back-end</h2><p>As implied by the name of this post, the communication between the front-end and the back-end is happening using the REST API. In the <a href=../creating-google-cloud-platform-function-with-python-and-serverless/ rel>previous post</a> I wrote about the way I packaged the <a href=https://github.com/dbarrosop/pycatj/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer"><code>pycatj</code></a> tool into a Google Cloud Function which exposes a single API endpoint. Now it is time to make our front-end to be a REST API client that talks to the back-end and displays the results it receives back.</p><p>This is a breakdown of a communication logic between the front and back ends:</p><ol><li>Capture the user input (which is a YAML or JSON formatted text) from the input field</li><li>Send it via <code>HTTP POST</code> request to the back-end API endpoint in a JSON format</li><li>Back-end to receives a request and does the transformation of the received data</li><li>It then sends the transformed data back as a string packed in a JSON body as well.</li></ol><h3 id=41-rest-api-client-with-jqueryajax class=headerLink><a href=#41-rest-api-client-with-jqueryajax class=header-mark></a>4.1 REST API client with JQuery/AJAX</h3><p>There are several ways of making an asynchronous HTTP request from within the front-end service. One approach would be by using the JQuery&rsquo;s <a href=https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">AJAX</a> function. Since MDB framework has JQuery as its dependency and this library is already loaded into our page we can use it right away.</p><p>Lets add a Javascript file at the <code>js/pycatjify.js</code> path that will implement the logic of a REST client.</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/hellt/93154da758722192beca0fdf80d53b3a.js></script><p>This little unnamed function is bound to the <a href=https://github.com/hellt/pycatj-web/blob/master/pycatj-web/index.html#L76 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">button</a> with id <code>convert_btn</code> by the means of the <code>#convert_btn</code> selector. Specifically to its <code>click</code> action. That means that when a click action occurs on the <code>convert_btn</code> button, this JS code kicks in.</p><p>In the very beginning the code reads the data from the input element text area into the <code>data["pycatj_data"]</code> object. Next, it serializes the variable value into the JSON string since we chose to use JSON payload with our POST request.</p><p>And then the actual AJAX request (which is essentially a JQuery name for the async HTTP call) comes into play:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre class=chroma><code><span class=lnt> 1

It goes without saying, that the example presented in this topic uses a very basic layout and a straightforward design - hence the overall simplicity. For instance the it does not handle any errors and does not perform input validation. Adding the spinner element to the UI to indicate the processing time would also enhance the UX.<br>You can imagine, that adding all of these features increases the complexity of the code base and might require additional components and/or libraries.</p><p>I hope this &ldquo;how to create a front-end being not a front-ender&rdquo; post helps you with the basics of a simple front-end machinery. Remember, its important to start, and its easier to start small, you can always grow later. And I think the Bootstrap-like frameworks are a good choice for that.</p><p>Checkout the <a href=https://github.com/hellt/pycatj-web target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">project&rsquo;s source code</a> and leave the comments or ask questions below if I missed something.</p></div><footer><div class=post><div class=post-share><div class=share-link><a class="share-icon share-twitter" href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Twitter" data-sharer=twitter data-url=https://netdevops.me/2019/creating-a-bootstrap-based-front-end-for-your-simple-rest-service/ data-title="Creating a Bootstrap based front-end for your simple REST service" data-via=ntdvps data-hashtags=javascript,frontend,bootstrap><span class="svg-social-icon icon-twitter"></span></a></div><div class=share-link><a class="share-icon share-facebook" href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Facebook" data-sharer=facebook data-url=https://netdevops.me/2019/creating-a-bootstrap-based-front-end-for-your-simple-rest-service/ data-hashtag=javascript><span class="svg-social-icon icon-facebook"></span></a></div><div class=share-link><a class="share-icon share-linkedin" href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Linkedin" data-sharer=linkedin data-url=https://netdevops.me/2019/creating-a-bootstrap-based-front-end-for-your-simple-rest-service/><span class="svg-social-icon icon-linkedin"></span></a></div></div><div class=post-tags><a href=/tags/javascript/ class=tag>javascript</a><a href=/tags/frontend/ class=tag>frontend</a><a href=/tags/bootstrap/ class=tag>bootstrap</a></div></div></footer></div><div id=toc-final></div></div></article><aside class=article-post><div class="content-block content-block-position block-donate"><div class=post><div class=title><div style=text-align:center><svg width="90" height="90" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="#fff" d="M376 30c-27.783.0-53.255 8.804-75.707 26.168-21.525 16.647-35.856 37.85-44.293 53.268-8.437-15.419-22.768-36.621-44.293-53.268C189.255 38.804 163.783 30 136 30 58.468 30 0 93.417.0 177.514c0 90.854 72.943 153.015 183.369 247.118l62.099 53.414C248.38 480.596 252.12 482 256 482s7.62-1.404 10.532-3.953l62.111-53.425C439.057 330.529 512 268.368 512 177.514 512 93.417 453.532 30 376 30z"/></svg></div><div style=text-align:center;margin-top:20px><span class=title>If any of my work was helpful, you can:</span></div></div><div class=donate-text><ul><li>✉️ Share this post with your colleagues</li><li>💬 Comment, ask questions and report any issues/typos found</li><li>💰 Make a one-time or recurring donation to support my work</li></ul></div><div class=donate-button><a href=https://github.com/sponsors/hellt class="button button-big button-white">Donate</a></div></div></div></aside><section class="page single comments content-block-position"><h1 class=display-hidden>Комментарии</h1><div id=comments><div id=utterances></div><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by <a href=https://utteranc.es/>Utterances</a>.</noscript></div></section></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer" title="Hugo 0.82.0">Hugo</a> | Theme - <a href="https://ublogger.netlify.app/?utm_source=https://netdevops.me/&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=config&utm_term=2.0.1" target=_blank title="uBlogger 2.0.1">uBlogger</a></div><div class=footer-line><i class="svg-icon icon-copyright"></i><span>2015 - 2022</span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span class=license><a rel="license external nofollow noopener noreffer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY-NC 4.0</a></span></div></div></footer></div><aside id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="svg-icon icon-arrow-up"></i>

The three-layered solution ranged from hardware platforms all the way up in the stack to the DC fabric lifecycle management suite - Fabric Services System (FSS).
At the very heart of the DC Fabric solution lies a purpose-built, modern Network OS - SR Linux.
SR Linux comes with quite some interesting and innovative ideas. By being able to design the NOS from the ground up, the product team was freed from the legacy burdens which will be there have they decided to built the NOS on top of the existing one.</description></item><item><title>Network automation options in Go with scrapligo</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2021/network-automation-options-in-go-with-scrapligo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2021/network-automation-options-in-go-with-scrapligo/</guid><description>Just recently the network automation folks witnessed a great library to be ported from Python to Go - scrapligo.
Been working on learning go a bit and have published scrapligo https://t.co/NDXQ6khxCr -- still a work in progress, but has been a fun learning experience! Check it out and let me know what ya think! ü§†
&amp;mdash; Carl Montanari (@carlrmontanari) May 19, 2021 For me personally this was a pivotal point because with scrapligo the Go-minded netengs can now automate their networks with a solid and performant library.</description></item><item><title>Containerlab - your network-centric labs with a Docker UX</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2021/containerlab-your-network-centric-labs-with-a-docker-ux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2021/containerlab-your-network-centric-labs-with-a-docker-ux/</guid><description>With the growing number of containerized Network Operating Systems (NOS) grows the demand to easily run them in the user-defined, versatile lab topologies. Unfortunately, container runtimes alone and tools like docker-compose are not a particularly good fit for that purpose, as they do not allow a user to easily create p2p connections between the containers.
Containerlab provides a framework for orchestrating networking labs with containers. It starts the containers, builds a virtual wiring between them to create a topology of users choice and then manages a lab lifecycle.</description></item><item><title>Building and publishing deb/rpm packages with goreleaser and fury.io</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2021/building-and-publishing-deb/rpm-packages-with-goreleaser-and-fury.io/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2021/building-and-publishing-deb/rpm-packages-with-goreleaser-and-fury.io/</guid><description>I am a huge fan of a goreleaser tool that enables users to build Go projects and package/publish build artifacts in a fully automated and highly customizable way. We&amp;rsquo;ve have been using goreleaser with all our recent projects and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any happier since then.
But once the artifacts are built and published, the next important step is to make them easily installable. Especially if you provide deb/rpm packages which are built with NFPM integration.</description></item><item><title>Transparently redirecting packets/frames between interfaces</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2021/transparently-redirecting-packets/frames-between-interfaces/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2021/transparently-redirecting-packets/frames-between-interfaces/</guid><description>Lately I have been consumed by an idea of running container-based labs that span containerized NOSes, classical VM-based routers and regular containers with a single and uniform UX.
Luckily the foundation was already there. With plajjan/vrnetlab you get a toolchain that cleverly packages qemu-based VMs inside the container packaging, and with networkop/docker-topo you can run, deploy and wire containers in meshed topologies.
One particular thing though we needed to address, and it was the way we interconnect containers which host vrnetlab-created routers inside.</description></item><item><title>How to patch Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa with UKSM?</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2021/how-to-patch-ubuntu-20.04-focal-fossa-with-uksm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2021/how-to-patch-ubuntu-20.04-focal-fossa-with-uksm/</guid><description>Running multiple VMs out of the same disk image is something we, network engineers, do quite often. A virtualized network usually consists of a few identical virtualized network elements that we interconnected with links making a topology.
In the example above we have 7 virtualized routers in total, although we used only two VM images to create this topology (virtualized Nokia router and it&amp;rsquo;s Juniper vMX counterpart). Each of this VMs require some memory to run, for the simplicity, lets say each VM requires 5GB of RAM.</description></item><item><title>Remove binaries and big files from git repo</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2021/remove-binaries-and-big-files-from-git-repo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2021/remove-binaries-and-big-files-from-git-repo/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>You slice and dice your files in a git repo like a pro and accidentally commit a binary file. It happened to you as well, don&rsquo;t pretend it didn&rsquo;t.<br>
Sooner or later you recognizes this file shouldn&rsquo;t be there, it is clogging your git repo for no reason. OK, you delete the file and commit. But the repo size doesn&rsquo;t get any smaller. Hm&hellip;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>How I create documentation sites for my projects?</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2020/how-i-create-documentation-sites-for-my-projects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2020/how-i-create-documentation-sites-for-my-projects/</guid><description>I am a firm believer that documentation is an integral part of the project. A terse, twisted, incomplete or sometimes even missing documentation penalizes your projects success. At the same time clean, concise and comprehensive documentation is not only something worth being proud of, but an opening to a users' appreciation and fame.
I am sharing the way I build, publish and host documentation sites for my projects via this live-example site - projectdocs.</description></item><item><title>gNMIc got better with YANG-completions</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2020/gnmic-got-better-with-yang-completions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2020/gnmic-got-better-with-yang-completions/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://gnmic.kmrd.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><code>gnmic</code></a> was the first opensource project that I&rsquo;ve been part of that got widely adopted.

<p>To our surprise, the very <a href="https://github.com/karimra/gnmic/pull/136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">first external contribution</a> laid out the foundation to one of the most exciting features of <code>gnmic</code> - YANG-Completions.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Arista vEOS gNMI Tutorial</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2020/arista-veos-gnmi-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2020/arista-veos-gnmi-tutorial/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>We were pleasantly surprised by the way community appreciated <a href="https://netdevops.me/2020/gnmic-gnmi-cli-client-and-collector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">gNMIc</a> release. Thank you üôè! That solidifies the fact that a well-formed, documented and easy to use gNMI tool was needed.</p>
<p>Now with gNMIc available to everybody its easy like never before to test gNMI implementation of different routing OSes. And in this post we will get our hands on <strong>Arista vEOS</strong>.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>

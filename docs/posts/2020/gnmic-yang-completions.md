title: gNMIc got better with YANG-completions
---
[`gnmic`](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev) was the first opensource project that I've been part of that got widely adopted. As the maintainers of a public project, Karim and I were wondering when would we get the first external contribution.

To our surprise, the very [first external contribution](https://github.com/karimra/gnmic/pull/136) laid out the foundation to one of the most exciting features of `gnmic` - YANG-Completions.

I thought that the best way to describe what YANG-completions is showing you a quick demo augmented with some comments. This resulted in this twitter-series:

We&amp;rsquo;ve have been using goreleaser with all our recent projects and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any happier since then.
But once the artifacts are built and published, the next important step is to make them easily installable. Especially if you provide deb/rpm packages which are built with NFPM integration.</description></item></channel></rss>

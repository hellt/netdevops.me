What seemed like a child&rsquo;s play first actually had some fun inside.</p>
<p>A problem were hidden right between the moment you spawned <code>ssh</code> process in the background and the next moment you tried to use this tunnel. In other words, it takes literally no time to spawn a process in the background, but without checking that tunnel is ready, you will quite likely receive an error, since your next instructions will be executed immediately after.</p>
<p>Consequently, I needed a way to ensure that the SSH service is ready before I try to consume it.</p>

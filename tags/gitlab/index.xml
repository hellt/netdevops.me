I don&rsquo;t know if Hugo' popularity coupled with <strong>the fastest static-site-generator</strong> statement, but for me &ldquo;speed&rdquo; is not the issue at all. A personal blog normally has few hundreds posts, not even close to thousands to be worried about slowness.</p>
<p>Then if it is not for speed then why did I choose Hugo? Because it became a solid product with a crowded community and all the common features available. <em>(To be honest I also got an illusion that one day I might start sharpen my Go skills through Hugo as well)</em>.</p>
<p>As you already noticed, this blog is powered by <strong>Hugo</strong>, is running on <strong>GitLab pages</strong>, with SSL certificate from <strong>CloudFlare</strong> and costs me <strong>$0</strong>. And I would like to write down the key pieces that&rsquo;ll probably be of help on your path to a zero-cost personal blog/cv/landing/etc.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>

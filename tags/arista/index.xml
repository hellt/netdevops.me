It starts the containers, builds a virtual wiring between them to create a topology of users choice and then manages a lab lifecycle.</description></item><item><title>Arista vEOS gNMI Tutorial</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2020/arista-veos-gnmi-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2020/arista-veos-gnmi-tutorial/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>We were pleasantly surprised by the way community appreciated <a href="https://netdevops.me/2020/gnmic-gnmi-cli-client-and-collector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">gNMIc</a> release. Thank you üôè! That solidifies the fact that a well-formed, documented and easy to use gNMI tool was needed.</p>
<p>Now with gNMIc available to everybody its easy like never before to test gNMI implementation of different routing OSes. And in this post we will get our hands on <strong>Arista vEOS</strong>.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>

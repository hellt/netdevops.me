Decided to tackle the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/coa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Openstack COA</a> certification first saving the Docker/Kubernetes certification for a later occasion.</p>
<p>There is a common joke floating around: <em>&ldquo;Oh, is Openstack still a thing?&quot;</em> - yes, its pretty much still a thing, especially in the Telecom area where VMs are the only viable option for the most of the cases (think VNFs).<br>
Openstack also powers our teams public SDN lab - <a href="https://nuagex.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">NuageX</a> - that allows to provision a fully functional Nuage environment in a matter of minutes. So I wanted to get a better operational knowledge of Openstack to be able to support and tune the platform if necessary.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I took the recently updated COA exam which is based on the Openstack Pike release, although I did not face any Pike-specific questions during the exam. This does not mean that the exam content will stay the same throughout the course evolution, so watch out for the updates.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>

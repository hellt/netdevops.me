The three-layered solution ranged from hardware platforms all the way up in the stack to the DC fabric lifecycle management suite - Fabric Services System (FSS).
At the very heart of the DC Fabric solution lies a purpose-built, modern Network OS - SR Linux.
SR Linux comes with quite some interesting and innovative ideas. By being able to design the NOS from the ground up, the product team was freed from the legacy burdens which will be there have they decided to built the NOS on top of the existing one.</description></item><item><title>Containerlab - your network-centric labs with a Docker UX</title><link>https://netdevops.me/2021/containerlab-your-network-centric-labs-with-a-docker-ux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://netdevops.me/2021/containerlab-your-network-centric-labs-with-a-docker-ux/</guid><description>With the growing number of containerized Network Operating Systems (NOS) grows the demand to easily run them in the user-defined, versatile lab topologies. Unfortunately, container runtimes alone and tools like docker-compose are not a particularly good fit for that purpose, as they do not allow a user to easily create p2p connections between the containers.
Containerlab provides a framework for orchestrating networking labs with containers. It starts the containers, builds a virtual wiring between them to create a topology of users choice and then manages a lab lifecycle.</description></item></channel></rss>

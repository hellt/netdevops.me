Why would a network engineer want to step into the game that seems orthogonal to its main area of expertise, one might ask?</p>
<p>Truth be told, I wasn&rsquo;t born with an urge to learn anything that has <em>javascript</em> under the hood, but over the years, working within the network/backend silos, I realized, that being able to create a simple front-end service is a jewel that fits every crown, no matter what title you wear.</p>
<p>This tutorial is based on the task real task of building up a web interface (<a href="https://pycatjify.netdevops.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">pycatjify.netdevops.me</a>) for the <a href="../creating-google-cloud-platform-function-with-python-and-serverless/" rel=""><code>pycatjify</code></a> REST API service deployed as a serverless function. The end result is a <strong>simple</strong>, completely <strong>free</strong> and <strong>reusable</strong> Bootstrap based front-end boilerplate which can be used as a foundation for a similar task.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>

# Subscribe

If you like the topics I touch upon in this blog and you want to get notified when a new post comes out - consider subscribing via one of the following mediums.

## Social media

I am an active :material-twitter:Twitter user and besides tweeting about network automation, announce new blog posts as they get out. You can find me there as [@ntdvps][twitter].

If twitter is not particularly your game, we may get connected on :material-linkedin: where my handle is [in/rdodin][linkedin]. I am announcing my posts there too.

## RSS

:skull: *What is dead may never die*. But, hey, if you still ride the :material-rss:RSS wave, I have you covered. This blog publishes two feeds:

- `https://netdevops.me/feed_rss_created.xml` - feed is updated whenever a new post is created.
- `https://netdevops.me/feed_rss_updated.xml` - feed is updated whenever a new post is **created or updated**.

Depending how thoroughly you want to monitor my blog you can choose between those two.

## Email

What is more reliable than email? Probably, nothing. You can get notifications in your mailbox by piggy-backing on the RSS feed using on of those RSS-to-Email services.

I personally use a free [blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com/) service, but if it doesn't suit you, there are other options like feedrabbit and IFTT.

In blogtrottr all you need to do is to enter `https://netdevops.me` in the site input and type in your email. Then select which feed you want to receive (see [rss section](#rss) for an explanation).

# SR Linux logging with ELK

Implementing centralized logging using modern log collectors is an interesting task even before you start solving scaling problems.

My colleague and I opened up a series of posts dedicated to logging in the context of datacenter networks. We started with the basics of SR Linux logging and used the famous ELK stack as our log storage/processing solution.

Integrating SR Linux logging with ELK via Syslog was fun, and we tried to capture every step of the way. Plus, we create a containerlab-based lab that anyone can use to test the solution themselves.

Dig into [**"SR Linux logging with ELK"**](https://learn.srlinux.dev/blog/2023/sr-linux-logging-with-elk/) and open up the world of modern logging.

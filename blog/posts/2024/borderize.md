# Adding border to the logos

It is super easy nowadays to generate a decent logo for your OSS project using any of genAI tool (dall-e, bing, etc). But one of the side-effects of the image generation might be the noise around the edges.

If that's your case you can apply a border (offset) to your logo to mask the potential rough edges. I can recommend [borderize](https://borderize.com/) service that makes it a matter of a few clicks.

# gNMIc got better with YANG-completions

[`gnmic`](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev) was the first opensource project that I've been part of that got widely adopted. As the maintainers of a public project, Karim and I were wondering when would we get the first external contribution.

To our surprise, the very [first external contribution](https://github.com/karimra/gnmic/pull/136) laid out the foundation to one of the most exciting features of `gnmic` - YANG-Completions.

I thought that the best way to describe what YANG-completions is showing you a quick demo augmented with some comments. This resulted in this twitter-series:

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ’»Fellow Network Automation engineers,<br>today is a special day for YANG-based automation as we release the &quot;YANG-completions&quot; feature with gnmic v0.4<br><br>I have only 1m30s to convince you that it is a dream turned into reality (or a black magic ðŸ’€)<a href="https://t.co/Nylyay1pl4">https://t.co/Nylyay1pl4</a> <a href="https://t.co/IOnumRCOZi">pic.twitter.com/IOnumRCOZi</a></p>&mdash; Roman Dodin (@ntdvps) <a href="https://twitter.com/ntdvps/status/1318933113951715334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

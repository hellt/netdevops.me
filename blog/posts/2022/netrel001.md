# Decoding gNMI with Wireshark

Okay, here goes my first attempt fitting the shoes of a content creator.

Please welcome the **NetRel episode 001 - Decoding gNMI with Wireshark**, it is a 35min journey of using Wireshark to parse the gNMI traffic (both non-secured and secured).

I won't spend your time explaining the first episode; instead, let me tell you what I want the NetRel series to be about. I am interested in covering the aspects of network automation that are not widely covered.

<!-- more -->

Luckily, my main line of work often offers me chances to work with the technologies relevant for webscalers. Hence, I will focus on the advanced content and not waste effort on the beginners' videos. A few broad topics that I wish to cover along the way:

- Go for network automation
- YANG based automation and programmable interfaces
- k8s as a network control plane
- gNxI interfaces

Quite convinced a few more topics will stem in time, but these are the current candidates.

Now a few words on why YT? Why now?

1.5 years ago I was willing to die on the hill of the text-based blogs. I do still love blogs and think they offer the best signal/noise ratio for knowledge transfer. But over time, I noticed how video blogs become dominant. I realized that I land on YT more often than stumble upon a text blog. So, as a viewer, I see how video material is getting ahead in terms of audience coverage and views.

The video genre also makes it easier to add interactivity to your content. Gifs & screenshots can't compete with a hands-on demo you can record with a voice-over. This was the second plus on the blogs-v-videos scales that inclined me to try out going solo on YT.

As far as content creation goes, in my case, the time required to create a video is > time needed to craft a blog post. But I can see how this can improve over time. The more you get used to the editing process and grow your library of intros/callouts/etc, the easier it gets. What helped me overstep the barrier of spending too much time in editing is making a contract with myself. If I stutter, misspel a word or make a grammar mistake I roll with it. Minimum cuts, maximum time to work on the content itself and not its form.

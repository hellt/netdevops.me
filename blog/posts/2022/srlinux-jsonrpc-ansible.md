# SR Linux, JSON-RPC and Ansible

This week I have authored two tutorials for our <https://learn.srlinux.dev> portal.

- [JSON-RPC Basics](https://learn.srlinux.dev/tutorials/programmability/json-rpc/basics/)
- [Using Ansible with SR Linux's JSON-RPC Interface](https://learn.srlinux.dev/tutorials/programmability/json-rpc/ansible/)

The prime reason for this deep dive was to help our customers marry Ansible automation platform with network operations on SR Linux NOS. While I am personally not in the camp "Ansible for network automation" users, the reality is that it is still used by many small/mid teams who by now have large collections of playbooks and trained engineers.
